# smoke-simulation

## Introduction
Smoke is a fluid, and we are going to be using the grid way of describing such a phenomenon. We will be implementing Visual Simulation of Smoke paper by Fedkiw et al(https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs237d/smoke.pdf).

### Simplified Navier-Stokes Equations
Navier-Stokes equations are partial differential equations that describe the motion of viscous fluid substances. One millenium prize problem is proving (or disproving) existence of their smooth solutions.
That is not what we are going to be doing today, mainly because we find it boring, not because we cannot do it. 




### Incompressible Euler equations
